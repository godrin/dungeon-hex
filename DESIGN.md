## Idea of the game
Dungeon crawling with the spirit of nethack, but with some major differences making
game experience in nethack quiet difficult to learn. First the game must be simple
to control. You wont need to learn so many keys. Instead complex interaction will be
done through menus. Next thing is obvious complexity. It should be reduced as much
as possible. You must not know all of the wizard spells and things properties.
You can play this game on occasion and you wont have difficulties coming right into the
flow.

## Major features
- each game is new and generated from random (this means not only generating the physical form of each game/ level but even generating the whole story itself from random)
- the game can be saved (and shared ?)

## Subgames
These are the typical subgames used in RPGs:
- explore dungeons
- gather resources
- fight monsters and level up
- solve puzzels (resource combination, keys for doors or boxes)
- do quests
### Quests
Perhaps Quests like:
- find sth or somebody
- bring peace (by like:talkin to someone or find sth an bring it to somebody or maybe even help somebody [by fighting his enemy])
- fight someone
- or solving kind of puzzles

Each of these subgames bring their own action/movitation-cycle. For the player to
hang on playing there must be enough rewards on each subgame:
- new graphics, surrounding for exploring dungeons
- many resources are transformed into fewer costly ones
- leveling up makes it easier to overcome enemies and fight new ones and may perhaps be needed to do certain quests
- solved puzzels must give some reward - either possibility to explore further, fight 
  a new enemy, get some rare resource, e.g.
- quests like puzzles
